# hello-world
First time Git'n er done.
As previously stated this is my first time Git'n er done. At least I hope to. We shall see. I have no programming background other than a semester of VB in college. That is when I decided maybe coding wasn't for me. I'm still in the IT world though so I'm just trying to gain a titter of knowledge.
